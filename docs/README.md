# Sigil docs

**Internal / pre-audit.** These documents describe intended design. They are
kept behind the pre-launch wall and are **not** published publicly until the
independent audit completes and trademark clears (brief, GTM Phase 1).

- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — the system shape: the client-side-crypto
  vs. zero-knowledge-server trust boundary and the life-of-one-record data flow
  (the doc to read first after this index).
- [`sprint-72h.md`](sprint-72h.md) — the 72-hour foundation sprint: definition
  of done, critical path, wall-clock gates, and the defer ledger.
- [`threat-model.md`](threat-model.md) — adversary classes and the defense layer
  for each (condensed from the product brief, §29).
- [`crypto-spec.md`](crypto-spec.md) — primitives, the algorithm-suite registry,
  the crypto-agility envelope, the hybrid construction, and the migration plan
  (condensed from the brief, §11/§20/§21).
- [`api.md`](api.md) — `sigild` HTTP reference: the `/healthz`, `/readyz`,
  `/version` probes and the **dev-only, opt-in, unauthenticated** opaque-blob
  vault op-log (default `501`).
- [`deployment.md`](deployment.md) — the (not-yet-applied) `sigild` deployment
  runbook: topology, secrets posture, PQ-TLS nuance, and an honest
  what-is-not-deployable / validation-status accounting.
- [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md) — Architecture Decision Records (the
  load-bearing *why*), Nygard-style and pre-audit.

Every line here is **subject to change**. Substantial parts of the scaffold now
exist and are tested (the crypto core, the CLI, the dev op-log server, and the
wasm/webapp clients), but the system as a whole is **pre-audit and not
production-ready**: nothing here is **audited**, and the product-level pieces
(accounts, enrollment, real auth, native apps) are **not yet built**.
