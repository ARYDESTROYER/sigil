## 2026-06-02 — Day 0/1: greenfield foundation scaffold

### Context & mandate
- Input: the Sigil v2 product/design/tech brief (61pp, a 12-month plan).
- Ask: a realistic 2–3 day deployment plan + domain availability, then **build it
  all from scratch and test everything**. Posture: pre-launch / stealth.
- Ground truth at start: repo was an empty `git init` (0 commits, 0 files, remote
  `github.com/ARYDESTROYER/sigil.git`). So this is pure greenfield scaffolding.

### Planning (done via a 9-agent workflow + adversarial critique)
- Committed 72h target: walled+no-index waitlist splash + committed monorepo with
  green CI + DNS/email foundation + backed-up Postgres. Stretch: live `sigild`
  over PQ-TLS; floor: healthz-only. Full plan recorded in `docs/sprint-72h.md`.
- The critique caught: fantasy hour budget, missing backups, privacy-policy
  sequencing, and that the local OpenSSL is LibreSSL (can't do PQ-TLS). All folded
  into `docs/sprint-72h.md`.

### Domain availability (live, via Vercel registrar)
- ⚠️ The bare **"Sigil" brand is taken on every credible TLD** (`sigil.app/.com/
  .io/.dev/.co/.net/.org/.xyz/.me/...`) and all common compounds (`get/use/try/
  join-sigil`, `sigilauth`, `sigilhq.com`, `sigilapp.com`). Shortlist fallbacks
  (`tessera/keepsake/witness/veil`) also taken on `.app`.
- Registrable: `sigilapp.io` ($38), `sigilhq.io` ($38), `sigilkeep.com` ($11),
  `vaultsigil.com` ($11), `heysigil.com` ($11), `sigil2fa.com` ($11).
- **Decision (user):** anchor working name on **`sigilapp.io`**. Used as a
  placeholder only; trademark knockout still runs before brand commitment.
  Domain not yet purchased (human action; outward-facing).

### Toolchains (macOS 14.8.2, arm64)
- Present at start: git, Homebrew, Node 20.12, Corepack, Docker. Missing: go, rust,
  pnpm, gh, cosign.
- Installed: **Go 1.26.3** (brew), **Rust stable rustc 1.96** (brew `rustup`),
  **pnpm 9.15** (corepack). 
- ⚠️ Homebrew `rustup` did **not** create `~/.cargo/bin` proxies and
  `rustup run stable cargo <subcmd>` failed to resolve subcommands. Fix:
  put `~/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin` directly on PATH.
  Documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
- ⚠️ System `openssl` is LibreSSL → cannot negotiate `X25519MLKEM768`. The PQ-TLS
  proof (stretch) needs OpenSSL 3.5+/Go 1.24.x provisioned first.

### Built & verified

**libsigil (Rust workspace: `core` + `ffi`)** ✅
- `core` = `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, `no_std`; `AlgorithmSuite` registry (bytes
  0x10–0x15, current 0x12), `ENVELOPE_VERSION`, `from_byte`/`as_byte`/
  `is_post_quantum`, 6 unit tests. `ffi` = `cdylib`+`rlib` exporting
  `sigil_current_suite()` smoke test. No real crypto (intentional).
- Verified: `cargo fmt --check` OK · `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings`
  clean · `cargo test` 6 pass (5 core + 1 ffi) · `cargo build -p sigil-core
  --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` OK.

**sigild (Go, stdlib only — hermetic, no external deps)** ✅
- `cmd/server` (graceful shutdown, slog, env config); `internal/api` router using
  Go 1.22+ method+pattern mux: `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz` (TCP-dial reachability
  of configured PG/Redis, 503 if a configured dep is unreachable, "unconfigured"
  otherwise), `GET|POST /v1/vaults/{vaultID}/ops` → 501 (no faked crypto).
  `internal/buildinfo` version var; stub packages `internal/{auth,vault,push,admin,
  store}`; `cmd/worker-{rehash,audit,breach}` stubs.
- Tests (`internal/api/handlers_test.go`): healthz 200, readyz-unconfigured 200,
  readyz-unreachable 503, ops 501 (GET+POST, body shape). 
- Decision: readyz uses plain `net.DialTimeout` (not pgx/redis) so the skeleton is
  dependency-free and tests run offline; documented to be swapped for real pings.
- Verified: `gofmt -l` clean · `go vet ./...` OK · `go test ./...` pass ·
  `go build ./...` OK.

**web/apps/marketing (Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind 3, pnpm workspace)** ✅
- Stealth splash (minimal copy, zero security superlatives — see
  MARKETING-CLAIMS.md), client `WaitlistForm` (email + honeypot + unchecked-default
  consent), `POST /api/waitlist` (validates; **persistence intentionally stubbed**,
  returns 202 — no un-backed-up PII, no consent referencing an unpublished policy),
  `privacy`/`terms`/`imprint` stub pages, `robots.ts` Disallow /, layout robots
  noindex, `next.config.mjs` `X-Robots-Tag`+security headers, `middleware.ts`
  Basic-Auth wall (no-op when `SITE_PASSWORD` unset), `public/.well-known/
  security.txt`.
- Fix applied: literal `//` logo text tripped `react/jsx-no-comment-textnodes` →
  wrapped as `{"//"}`.
- Verified: `pnpm typecheck` OK · `pnpm lint` clean · `pnpm build` OK (9 routes +
  middleware generated).

**CI / security** ✅
- `.github/workflows/{libsigil,sigild,web}.yml` (path-filtered, mirror the local
  commands), inert `release.yml` (`if: false` — cosign/SLSA deferred),
  `.github/dependabot.yml` (cargo/gomod/npm/actions), `.gitleaks.toml`.

**Docs / meta** ✅
- `README.md`, `LICENSE` (split explainer), `LICENSE-APACHE` (canonical, curl'd),
  `.gitignore`/`.editorconfig`/`.nvmrc`/`CODEOWNERS`/`SECURITY.md`.
- `docs/{crypto-spec,threat-model,sprint-72h,README}.md` (internal/pre-audit).
- `CLAUDE.md` (this guide) + `journal.md` (this file).

### Decisions & justifications
- **Stdlib-only sigild** for the skeleton → hermetic builds/tests, no network in
  CI, no `go.sum`. Real pgx/redis come with the real endpoints.
- **Hand-rolled Next app** (not create-next-app) → exact control of no-index +
  Basic-Auth + claims discipline; pinned Next 15.1.6 / React 19.0.0 / Tailwind 3.
- **No faked crypto/persistence anywhere** → protects the future Cure53 story and
  the "have read the privacy policy" consent validity.
- **Anchor `sigilapp.io` as placeholder**, brand/trademark unresolved.

### ⛔ Deferred (out of 72h scope — see docs/sprint-72h.md defer ledger)
- libsigil crypto correctness; full sigild API + workers + ClickHouse; webapp/
  admin/extension/native clients; live payments + Stripe/Razorpay verification;
  permanent App Store bundle ID; status page; Nomad/K8s/multi-region; reproducible
  Nix builds + working cosign/SLSA; Cure53 completion; SOC 2/ISO.

### ➡️ Next (this session)
1. `sigild/LICENSE` (BSL-1.1); `deploy/` stubs (Caddy, systemd, Terraform, Nomad);
   leaf READMEs for reserved dirs.
2. Full test sweep across all three toolchains again + validate CI YAML parses.
3. Summarize; **hold** commit/push/domain-purchase/deploy for explicit human OK.

### ⚠️ Operational note
- Output is being intermittently blocked by an upstream content filter (false
  positives on security/crypto language + secret-looking strings). Mitigation:
  smaller chunks, no verbatim secret-like strings. Files already written are intact.

### Session close — final verification sweep ✅ (all green)
- **Rust:** `cargo fmt --check` OK · `clippy --all-targets -D warnings` clean ·
  `cargo test` 4 suites green · `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build OK.
- **Go:** `gofmt -l` clean · `go vet ./...` OK · `go test ./...` pass ·
  `go build ./...` OK.
- **Runtime smoke (real binary):** built with version ldflags; `/healthz`→200
  (`version: v0.0.1-skeleton`), `/readyz`→200 (deps unconfigured), ops GET/POST
  →501, unknown→404, graceful SIGTERM shutdown logged. ✅
- **Web:** `pnpm typecheck` OK · `pnpm lint` clean · `pnpm build` OK (9 routes +
  middleware). Fixed `react/jsx-no-comment-textnodes` (`{"//"}`).
- **CI YAML:** all 5 files parse (validated via Ruby YAML). Fixed `release.yml`
  (`TODO:` colon-space in an unquoted `run:` scalar broke YAML).
- **Tree:** 83 source files tracked; `target/`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`,
  `*.tsbuildinfo` confirmed git-ignored.
- **Decision:** licenses — kept `LICENSE`/`LICENSE-APACHE`; server BSL text
  **skipped per user**; dangling refs softened to "deferred".
- **Held (need explicit human OK):** git commit + push, domain purchase
  (`sigilapp.io`), any public deploy. Repo still has 0 commits by design.

### ➡️ Next (when human returns)
1. Approve the first signed commit + push, OR keep iterating locally.
2. Buy `sigilapp.io` (or chosen name) → Cloudflare zone → Postmark DKIM/SPF/DMARC.
3. Provision PQ-TLS client (OpenSSL 3.5+) before attempting the stretch sigild VM.

### Commit `0edd579` — genesis scaffold ✅
- 83 files, working tree clean. Local commit on `main`, unsigned (no signing key
  configured), **not pushed** (user buying the domain; push not requested).

### Dev increment #1 — libsigil crypto-agility envelope codec ✅
- Added `libsigil/core/src/envelope.rs`: `Envelope { suite, aad, nonce,
  ciphertext, tag, kem_ct }` with `encode()`/`decode()`. Concrete self-describing
  format `0x01` — per-field unsigned-LEB128 varint length prefixes + a `flags`
  byte for the optional `kem_ct`. **Serialization only; no encryption** (does not
  fake crypto). `core` now `extern crate alloc`.
- Rationale: lands the crypto-AGILITY property (suite byte travels inside the
  frame → migrate suites without flag-day re-encryption) without touching real
  crypto, which stays weeks out per the brief.
- Design note: the brief's prose layout left nonce/ct/tag boundaries
  implicit-by-suite; chose explicit length prefixes so the frame parses
  unambiguously and is testable. Documented in `docs/crypto-spec.md`.
- Tests (8 new): round-trip with/without kem_ct, header bytes, empty fields,
  multibyte varint length (5000-byte field), reject bad version / unknown suite /
  truncated / trailing bytes. Verified: fmt --check ✓ · clippy -D warnings ✓ ·
  `cargo test` 14 core + 1 ffi ✓ · wasm32 build ✓.
- Committed `bbf496f`.

### Dev increment #2 — sigild HTTP middleware ✅
- Added `sigild/internal/api/middleware.go`: `requestID` (assign/propagate
  `X-Request-ID`, stash in ctx), `accessLog` (one structured slog line per
  request — method/path/status/bytes/dur; **never logs bodies**, so no vault
  material reaches logs), `recoverer` (panic → 500), `statusRecorder`, and a
  `chain()` helper. Wired into `NewRouter` (recoverer → requestID → accessLog →
  mux).
- Tests (4): ID generated, inbound ID propagated, recoverer → 500, `newRequestID`
  unique + 16-hex. Live check: `X-Request-Id` emitted (`55ee765f…`) and an
  inbound `my-trace-123` propagated.
- Verified: gofmt ✓ · vet ✓ · test ✓ · build ✓.
- Committed `0a9a13c`; pushed `main` → `origin/main` (user authorized push;
  domain purchase still in progress on their side).

## 2026-06-02 — Phase 2 (3 parallel agents via workflow `wu9u3qp47`)

Ran a workflow with 3 agents over disjoint subtrees (libsigil / sigild / web).
Each was constrained to its directory, forbidden from touching shared files or
committing. **I re-verified everything myself** (did not trust agent self-reports)
before committing.

### libsigil — real (unaudited) AEAD layer ✅
- New `core/src/aead.rs`: `seal()`/`open()` over the Envelope using
  XChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20poly1305 0.10) keyed by HKDF-SHA256 (hkdf 0.12 +
  sha2 0.10). Per-record key = HKDF(info = `sigil-record-v1` || suite_byte), so
  keys are bound to the suite. Nonces passed in (no RNG in core). Fail-closed:
  tamper/wrong-key/wrong-suite → `AeadError::Authentication`, no plaintext leak.
- wasm SAFETY: all three crates added with `default-features = false` to keep
  `getrandom` out of the tree — I confirmed **0 getrandom entries in Cargo.lock**
  and the wasm32 build stays green.
- Honest pre-audit caveats in the module docs (suite bound via key not AAD; no
  zeroization; no KEM/rotation yet). 14 new tests.

### sigild — hardening ✅
- Typed JSON error envelope (`internal/api/errors.go`, `writeError`); refactored
  the 501 ops + 500 recoverer to use it.
- 64 KiB per-op body limit (`limitBody` middleware + MaxBytesReader): oversized →
  413 `payload_too_large`; small body still → 501. (Brief §14: 64 KiB cap.)
- New `internal/store`: `KV` interface + concurrency-safe in-memory `MemKV`
  (RWMutex, defensive copies, sorted List). No crypto/DB. Tests incl. concurrency.

### web — `/security` page ✅
- `app/security/page.tsx`: no-index "Cryptographic posture" PQC table; every row
  qualified (designed/in-development/planned/pre-audit/unaudited); intro is an
  explicit negation; status-vocabulary key; clarifies FIPS names ≠ certification.
  Footer link added. No forbidden claims (claims-grep clean).

### My independent verification (the real gate) ✅
- Rust: fmt --check ✓ · clippy -D warnings ✓ · **27 tests** ✓ · wasm32 ✓ ·
  getrandom absent ✓.
- Go: gofmt ✓ · vet ✓ · test (api + store) ✓ · build ✓.
- Web: typecheck ✓ · lint ✓ · build ✓ (`/security` route present).
- Updated README.md + CLAUDE.md crypto-status lines (the "no real crypto" line
  was now stale).

## 2026-06-02 — Phase 3 (workflow `w00itf376`, all opus 4.8 agents)

Goal: finish the symmetric key chain (add the Argon2id front end), expose the
AEAD across the FFI boundary, and harden CI. Per the user's standing directive
("use sub agents for everything, always opus 4.8"), all build work ran through
opus workflow agents; **I re-ran the full gate myself before committing.**

Recovery note: an earlier Phase-3 run (`wkpeg2g7k`) was interrupted by a
`/compact` and left a **half-applied** tree — `kdf.rs` existed but `lib.rs` had
no `mod kdf;`, and `Cargo.lock` listed `argon2` while `Cargo.toml` did not
declare it. This run rebuilt to a consistent state from that partial work.

### libsigil/core — Argon2id KDF, wired in ✅
- `core/src/kdf.rs`: `derive_master_key(password, salt, Argon2Params)` →
  `[u8; 32]`, real Argon2id (argon2 0.5.3, `Version::V0x13`) via
  `hash_password_into`. `Argon2Params::RECOMMENDED` = brief's m=65536 KiB
  (64 MiB) / t=4 / p=2. **No RNG**: the salt is the caller's responsibility
  (keeps the crate wasm-clean). `KdfError` maps Argon2 errors to
  Invalid{Params,Salt}/Hash. 7 tests (determinism, salt/password sensitivity,
  short-salt + bad-params rejection) use tiny FAST params so they're instant.
- Wired into `lib.rs` (`mod kdf;` + re-exports `derive_master_key`,
  `Argon2Params`, `KdfError`, `MASTER_KEY_LEN`); crate doc now shows the full
  key chain (password → Argon2id → master key → HKDF → per-record key →
  XChaCha20-Poly1305), all labelled pre-audit / building-block.
- **wasm guardrail held:** `argon2` added with `default-features = false,
  features = ["alloc"]` so the `rand`/`password-hash`→`rand_core`→`getrandom`
  edge stays inactive. Confirmed **0 getrandom in Cargo.lock** and wasm32 green.
  (argon2 pulls base64ct/blake2/cpufeatures/password-hash/rand_core into the
  lockfile, but none activate getrandom.)

### libsigil/ffi — real (unaudited) C-ABI seal/open ✅
- `ffi/src/lib.rs`: `sigil_seal` / `sigil_open` / `sigil_buffer_free` over an
  `#[repr(C)] SigilBuffer { *mut u8, usize }`, plus the existing
  `sigil_current_suite`. Status codes: `SIGIL_OK`=0, `_ERR_NULL_ARG`=-1,
  `_ERR_OPEN`=-2 (decode + auth failures collapse to one code → no structure
  leak, never writes `*out`), `_ERR_BAD_INPUT`=-3.
- Memory contract: library owns the heap slice until `sigil_buffer_free`; empty
  outputs normalise to `{null,0}` to dodge the dangling-empty-Vec free trap.
- `#![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` kept; every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:`
  note; `# Safety` doc sections on all exports. Hand-written `ffi/include/sigil.h`
  (no cbindgen dependency — offline) mirrors the structs/codes/prototypes.
- 7 ffi tests: round-trip, tamper→`_ERR_OPEN`, garbage/truncated→error-not-crash,
  null-arg, empty-plaintext round-trip, free-empty no-op.
- core's `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is untouched; all the unsafe lives in ffi.

### CI — security scanning ✅
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`: gitleaks (full history) + govulncheck
  (sigild, Go 1.24.x) + cargo-audit (libsigil), on push/PR + weekly Monday cron.

### My independent verification (the real gate) ✅
- Rust: fmt --check ✓ · clippy -D warnings ✓ · **34 core + 7 ffi tests** ✓ ·
  wasm32 ✓ · `grep -c getrandom Cargo.lock` = **0** ✓.
- Go: gofmt ✓ · vet ✓ · test (api + store) ✓ · build ✓.
- Web: typecheck ✓ · lint ✓ · build ✓ (10 routes).
- YAML: all 5 workflow files parse (ruby `YAML.load_file`).
- Over-claim scan: every "audited"/"secure" hit is a negation/caveat; no
  "SOC 2" / "post-quantum secure" / unqualified "end-to-end encrypted".
- Reviewed the ffi `unsafe` line-by-line (null checks, slice bounds, Box
  reconstruction) myself before committing.
- Tightened now-stale core crate-doc wording ("pure, dependency-free" →
  "cryptographic"; "pulls in only core" → "core + alloc, not std") and refreshed
  README/CLAUDE crypto-status + repo-map lines to name the KDF and the FFI API.

## 2026-06-04 — Phase 4 (workflow `wnwct8sms`, 3 parallel opus tracks + verify)

Theme: deployment readiness + the composed encryption API. Three disjoint
subtrees ran in parallel (libsigil/core · sigild · deploy+docs), then one
independent verifier; **I re-ran the gate and the container smoke myself.**

### libsigil/core — composed record API ✅
- New `core/src/record.rs`: `seal_record(password, salt, params, nonce, aad,
  plaintext) -> Vec<u8>` and `open_record(password, salt, params, bytes)`,
  composing Argon2id → AEAD → envelope codec into the single call a client makes.
  `RecordError { Kdf, Aead, Envelope }` with `From` impls (`?`). **No new
  crypto** — it only wires existing blocks. `open_record` decodes *before*
  deriving the key so garbage is rejected without paying the Argon2id cost.
- Wired into `lib.rs` (`mod record;` + re-exports); crate doc names it the
  end-to-end entry point. 8 tests (round-trip, wrong-password→Aead-auth-fail,
  tamper, key-path determinism, empty, garbage/truncated/empty→Envelope).
- Honest caveats: `(salt, params)` are NOT in the envelope — caller must persist
  them; nonce-reuse is the caller's job; no zeroization; not an account/rotation
  system.

### sigild — container + `/version` ✅
- `GET /version` → `{"name":"sigild","version":<buildinfo>}` (no secrets, no
  crypto) + `TestVersion`. Multi-stage `Dockerfile` (golang:1.24-alpine builder,
  `CGO_ENABLED=0 -trimpath -ldflags …Version=$VERSION` → `gcr.io/distroless/
  static-debian12:nonroot`, USER nonroot, EXPOSE 8080) + `.dockerignore`. No
  Docker HEALTHCHECK by design (distroless has no shell; orchestrator probes
  `/healthz`). sigild still does NO crypto / NO storage; ops still `501`.

### deploy + docs — runbook ✅
- New `docs/deployment.md`: topology (systemd VM → Nomad+image → k8s), artifact
  flow, the PQ-TLS-must-be-proven-on-the-Go-listener caveat, DNS/ACME wall-clock
  gate, secrets posture, a "what is NOT yet deployable" section, and a validation
  status table. `deploy/README.md` + nomad image comment point at `sigild/
  Dockerfile`.

### My independent gate (the real commit gate) ✅
- Rust: fmt ✓ · clippy -D warnings ✓ · **42 core + 7 ffi tests** ✓ · wasm32 ✓ ·
  getrandom **0** ✓ · `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` intact.
- Go: gofmt ✓ · vet ✓ · test (api + store, incl. `/version`) ✓ · build ✓.
- Web: unchanged this phase (no `web/` edits) — prior green build still holds.
- **Docker smoke (first-hand):** built the image (**13.9 MB** distroless), ran
  it, and probed the live container — `/healthz` + `/version` carried the stamped
  `VERSION` build-arg, `/readyz` → deps `unconfigured`, ops → `501`. Cleaned up.
- **Caught a cross-track inaccuracy:** Track C wrote deployment.md §8 saying the
  Docker daemon was stopped and the image was "NOT built", but Track B had
  brought the daemon up and built+probed it. Corrected §8 (and the intro) to the
  truth — image built/validated locally; only terraform/caddy/nomad/systemd
  validators remain uninstalled. (Accuracy is the whole point here.)
- Refreshed CLAUDE repo-map/build-commands (added the docker build) and the
  Git/deploy note (no longer "no commits yet").
